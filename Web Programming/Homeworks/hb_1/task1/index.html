		<p>This is <i>Jack</i>. He studies in <i>SDU</i> and works and tired as hell and gone crazy these days. <i>All that can make him happy and calm him is a new MacBook Pro</i> that he finally bought for his salary and student loan.</p>
		<p>Jack would really like:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Double cheeseburger from Bahandi.</li>
			<li>To go hiking to the Furmanov peak.</li>
			<li>Radio-controlled toy helicopter.</li>
			<li>He would also like a real helicopter, too.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>You can find all this stuff (and more) and find people to go hiking with in my online store: <a href="http://zhassbala.beget.tech/">zhassbala.beget.tech</a> </p>
